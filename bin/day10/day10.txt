Object oriented programming language:
----------
class
object
polymorphism
encapsulation
inheritence
data abstraction


class contains methods
its a category or class is collection of attributes and behaviour.
ex., 

categories are Animal--> dog, elephant, horse etc. these having own attributes and behaviour,
categories are Students-->kim, devid, scott etc., these having own attributes and behaviour
categories are Organization-->emp1, emp2, emp3., these having own attributes and behaviour

its a blue print-->before constructing a house we would have a plan, based on that only we will build house

one class we can create multiple objects
group of objects are called class
class is virtual entity

Object:
object is an instance of class

Class: in JAVA
-------------
 
1) class is collection of variable and methods
2) class is logical entity- its a blue print and its a virtual, if its not physical,
so it will  not occupy space in the memory


class Employee

{
variables
methods
}


Object: in JAVA
------------------------

object is dervied from class itself

object is an instance of class. in otherwords object will be created using class.
object is a physical entity
it occupy some sapce in memory
we can create n number of objects in single classs

how to create object: using new ClassName

  Employee emp1= new Employee();
  Employee emp2= new Employee();
  Employee emp3= new Employee();


once we create an objcet, that object can owns all the variables and methods

but there is no connection between all thse 3 objects

It has separate memory
objects are independent, so its stored in memory in different space.


without create main method we can't execute class file

the main method where in the class called main class

Normally we will able to access all the class which available in the same project by main class


 if you want to access variable methods from other or external package in same project , we have to import in main class as following
 
 import packagename.className; 
 
 if both are same package no need to import
 
 once if the variables are assigned in class it will be common for all the objects
 
 if all the objects having same data , that time only shoud decalre variable value in class level
 
 if any one object has differnt data,  we should assign values by object level in main class
