Inheritance:
------------------------------------------

so for in oops we covered, class, objects, polymorphism, encapsulation
no this is inheritance

what is inheritance?
----------------------
acquiring all the properties (variables) and behaviour (methods) from one class to another

ClassA
{
variables1
methods1
}

ClassB{

variables2
methods2
}


if i need same details from A class to B class, use extends keywords to acquire those varaibles and methods

ClassB extends ClassA    (here class A--parent/base/super)  (ClassB--child/sub/derived)

advantage of inheritance: acheive re-usbality and avoid duplication


Bank -package

base class having 5 unique feature
personal loan also have 10 class  and we can extend those base class
home loan class also 10 have 5 class and we can extend those base class


types:

Single ---> one parent and one child
multilevel---->one parent can have another child that child have another child  --chaining
hierarchy-->only one  parent have multiple childs
multiple--->multiple parents have single child --using class concept we cant achieve by interface only we can achiev multiple inheritance


same class name should not be used anywahere in same package
