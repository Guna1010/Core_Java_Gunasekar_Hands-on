
Method Overriding:
-----------------------

overriding is possible only with inheritance : because atleast 2 class needed

we have to create object for the respective class and call the respective method with the new implementation

whatever the method we already created in parent class, in the child class  wherever you want to change the methods implementation

why its required: if we dont want old implementation or customization
condition: we should not change the declarartion (method name, return type, data type,  parameter, order of para, access modifier) or simply tell definition should be same

class Parent

m1(){

}


class Child extends Parent

m1(){
just changing implementation
}


Diff b/w method overloading & method overriding
-----------------------------------------------

method overrriding:

1) possible only in multiple classes (with inheritance)
2) we should not change the signature of the method but body we should change
3) method name are same
4) belongs to inheritance

method overriding:

1)possible in single & multiple classes (inheritance)
2) we should change the signature of the method
3) method names are same
4) belongs to polymorphism


------------------------------------
Final Keyword:
----------------------------

we can apply for variable class and methods

variables- we cant change the value of variables (constant)
methods-we cant override those methods in child class
class- we cant extends the class



whenever value of the variable is common for irrespective of objects we can set it as static
static keyword can apply only for varaible and methods

whenever overriding how to call method?

classname.methodname();


static methods we can overload/override
but final method we cant

--------------------------
Super
------------------------------------

it is again related to overriding concept

if you create object for parent class you can variable/method from parent class
if you want to access parent class variable and method by child class object use super keyword
beacuse super referring immediate parent class-- means it will give old implementation and old value

super kw will be used to invoke immediate parent class variable
super kw will be used to invoke immediate parent class method
